                            know how to organize a protest, but they do know some protestor rights, though not all. The user <b>decided to attend protests</b> during the pandemic because they do not have a family member who is immunocompromised; otherwise
                            they would not have gone. However, the user expressed that they <b>feel scared protesting during the pandemic</b> because they live close to New York City. The user has heard <b>conflicting information</b> on what to bring
                            to a protest: they do not know if they should bring their phone or not.

                        prefer having a trained medical person around</b> if someone has been tear gassed or hit with rubber bullets. They would not bring a phone or wallet with them to a protest, but they would bring a mask (both for protection and hiding
                            identity), comfortable shoes, and cash. They said they <b>do know most of their rights, but has 
                        heard many people say they do not know all of their rights</b>. The user also said that many of the protests they heard of had already been in progress for a while, so they could not attend. They said that <b>donating to and signing petitions of 
                        uncredible organizations are not a big issue</b>.

                        <p>This user has <b>attended protests before</b> and seems like they are <b>very actively involved with several movements</b> that are already well established and have members that are experienced in community organizing. This has
                            helped them
                            <b>organize other forms of protests</b>, including: walkouts, press conferences, and marches as well as <b>knowing how to take care of themselves before, during, and after a protest</b>. When asked if they knew what they would
                            do if someone near them were to get injured, they were hesitant about their ability, and also commented that they <b>only knew the basics of first aid</b>, as well as the hypothetical treatment of tear gas. They also seemed
                            unsure of the amount of petitions they have signed, and also stated that they only sign the petitions and do not share them afterwards. They do not actively seek out organizations or sites to which to donate. Something I found
                            to be interesting about their aftercare from a protest is that they suggested that one do “literally nothing,” especially because we see a culture of excessive productivity that make people want to keep going even though they
                            do not give themselves the adequate care for their mental, emotional, and physical self.

                        <p>Interviewee #5 <b>has been involved</b> in movements <b>but wants to contribute more</b>. She has seen people, including celebrities and companies, speak up, but she thinks their <b>activism appears performative and fails to make a difference</b>                            ("Companies and celebrities are all posting, but do they really care?"). At the same time, she is <b>concerned that her own activism and maybe even 
                        activism in general is insufficient to foster change</b> ("I think it really takes a personal epiphany for people to change their ways or care about a cause they previously didn't care about"), particularly during this pandemic,
                            when she <b>cannot protest because a member of her family is 
                        immunocompromised</b>. She is <b>frustrated by misinformation</b>, which is frequently supported and spread by her family and friends and which she is not always able to debunk, because they come in such large volumes or are technically
                            true but incredibly misleading. Although she cares about certain causes, when she encounters people with opposing arguments, she <b>finds herself 
                        doubting these causes</b> ("I definitely care about many causes, but sometimes I hear people in authority, like the President, discrediting them. It's often fake and just slander, but sometimes I can't help but to question whether
                            they are even slightly right, and it makes me doubt myself"). One of the primary issues that deters her is <b>not being listened to</b> or <b>being 
                        insulted for her passion</b> ("When I've tried to have these conversations, people ignored me or called me a SJW”). She is most <b>mobilized by statistics 
                        and facts and when she knows she is helping people</b> ("I'm motivated when I see statistics that bring the extent of the issue to light").

                        <p>
                            This interviewee <b>would benefit from educational resources</b>, particularly objective information, about causes and why they are necessary. This would help her debunk the misinformation that concerns her and combat attacks
                            against legitimate causes. She could also benefit from <b>protesting tips and information</b> and <b>information about ways to support movements and why these methods are effective</b>.

                        <p>Interviewee #6 is similarly <b>concerned with social issues</b> and is <b>motivated by 
                        a desire to improve others’ lives and society as a whole</b>, but he <b>feels that 
                        he can do little to make a difference</b> ("At the end of the day, I 'm not really seeing change").

                        </p>
                        His family is against activism and has caused him to <b>think of activism as a waste of time</b> (“My family is from a culture that especially doesn’t like to waste time, and they consider one person advocating for a cause a waste”),
                        even though he <b>tries to stay informed</b> (“I make sure to check what's trending every day ") and is <b>angered by what 
                        he sees</b> ("It makes me boil up inside seeing what police do and how people still don 't care"). This is especially so for protests, which he views as potentially dangerous even if they are peaceful ("My parents think protests
                        are too dangerous. I couldn't even do contact sports in school "). He <b>thinks 
                        certain actions are not effective and that wide-scale change is not truly 
                        possible</b>, because there are many people, many of whom are in power, who are against social movements and are unwilling to concede, and because people are motivated by trends and emotion, which subside (“The momentum is probably
                        gonna die out soon"). <b>Accounts of real experiences create the most impact for him</b> (“Anything affecting people affects me and makes me pay attention more."). He is <b>most likely to take action if he knows he is able 
                        to reach and genuinely help a large number of people</b> ("I wish I could give a speech to a million people").
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This interviewee would likely benefit from resources catered to different generations and cultures, especially those that are translated, as he could present these to his family, who is a major obstacle against his involvement in social movements. He
                            says he looks for ways to take action and that he definitely needs to do so, but his (lack of) actions do not reflect that: he could benefit from <b>guides as to how to begin taking action</b> and
                            <b>guides as to how and why to protest</b>, since he is particularly unfamiliar with protesting. More importantly, Interviewee #6 <b>needs to be shown that supporting causes is not a waste of time</b>, an idea he brought up
                            repeatedly and was originally sourced from his parents but which he now seems to believe himself. We could provide <b>examples of how various organizations and causes and even individuals have effected change</b>. He prefers
                            to <b>donate skills over time and money</b>, so demonstrating ways for him to do so (and thus exercise his skills and not waste time) would be helpful. Finally, since this interviewee is motivated by helping other people, we
                            can <b>demonstrate how issues affect people and what he can do to help them</b>.
