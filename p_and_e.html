                <div class="panel paragraph">
                    <p>The designs we presented in class were website designs, but we used the feedback we received to guide and refine our mobile designs, and we also decided to incorporate additional features into our application.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We decided to use a bottom navigation bar in our application. Doing so maintains external consistency, as this is a common feature in many mobile applications. According to our plan, Time to Help will have three “tabs,” or sections: Home, Explore, and
                        Events. The navigation bar will include both icons and text as signifiers for each tab. There is also a search bar and an “Account” button at the top of each screen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Given that our user base is low on time, we realized they might not have the availability to complete activities immediately upon discovering them. Our solution to this problem is adding “save” and “schedule” features. Users who are too busy to complete
                        an activity now may choose to save it for later and/or schedule a time to complete it (if the time is not already set (ex. protests). Saved activities can be found under a user’s “Account” screen, while scheduled activities, as
                        well as recommended activities and nearby events, can be found under “Events.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For this reason, our team also decided to add an account feature. When we had previously discussed an account feature, we were initially concerned with users’ safety and time as well as promoting performative activism. But our plan is to have accounts
                        for individual purposes; the application will not take the form of social media, as users cannot interact with each other or have a public profile. This approach allows for the convenient saving and scheduling functions while allowing
                        users to remain anonymous and safe and ensuring that they are not only using the application itself for performative reasons. We also concluded that a social media application would not be the best for our users, seeing as they
                        have little time on their hands. Additionally, users can choose not to create an account, but they will not be able to save or schedule activities in the application. They can, however, still share and retrieve information from
                        the application and save it and schedule it elsewhere. This enables both users who do not even have the time to create an account and those who do not want to or cannot use this application regularly to enjoy its original features
                        still.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another reason why including an account feature is useful is that it will allow users to follow keywords. In a manner similar to following hashtags on platforms such as Instagram, users will be able to stay up to date with new activities and events, which
                        will be accessible in the “Home” tab, which itself is divided into two sections: “Following” and “Time to Spare,” the search feature with time, cause, movement, and activity preference filtering options mentioned in our presentation.
                        We decided to add this feature because it saves users time: allowing them to access the information they desire without searching for it each time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We received feedback that our project’s emphasis on time is helpful and unique and decided to maintain and enhance this emphasis. Time estimates will be given for each activity instead of used only in the search results for “Time to Spare,” as initially
                        described.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the “Explore” section, users will be able to discover various activities, news, causes, and movements. They can browse by activity, by cause, by movement, and more, as well as filter and sort their results to their preference.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We have vertical and horizontal scroll bars/indicators to act as affordances, communicating to users how much content there is left.
                    </p>

                <div class="panel">

                        <p>
                            We continued to consider usability in our design. As mentioned in P3, learnability and efficiency are especially crucial for our users. The application is straightforward and uses large, spaced out elements for legibility, precision (“fat fingers”), efficiency
                            (reducing clutter), and error prevention. We incorporated horizontal scrolling to reduce clutter further. Additional design choices include using shadow and color to emphasize action buttons, arrows to act as signifiers, and
                            color change of icons/buttons (ex. Schedule/Save) after they are pressed to provide feedback, helping users understand actions/features and preventing error.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We also applied Gestalt principles. For example, in the “For You” page, each activity/news article is bordered and has a similar layout. This draws upon the principles of similarity, proximity, and common region. Users can recognize from similarity and
                            proximity that the activities/articles are grouped together as posts on their feed and from common region that text in each individual section contains information about a single activity/article. Another example of applying
                            these principles is illustrated in the Save/Schedule/Share buttons, grouped together and divided from the main posts in the Explore pages: communicating that they serve a distinct purpose and are separate from the post itself.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We created our prototype in dark mode due to the accessibility, functionality, and health benefits dark mode themes provide. For instance, dark mode uses less light and thus saves energy. Our users are often on the go and may not have constant access
                            to a power source. Dark mode also reduces eye strain, particularly in low light situations, and screen glare. Our busy users may use this application at night after having a full schedule during the day, which is a reason why
                            we wanted to include and test a dark theme option we expect to be used regularly, especially since usage of dark mode is growing. We plan to include a light mode option to accommodate various user needs and for use in bright
                            light conditions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For our color scheme, we used a cool, dark grey for the background instead of black, as dark grey surfaces can better express color, elevation, and depth, and because viewing the high contrast between white text and a pure black background can be painful.
                            We used a darker grey/near-black for our navigation bars, which lack text. Doing so highlights the central, less dark content. We also used grey for elements such as borders. This emphasizes the white text and makes it more
                            prominent among grey layout details. Our primary accent color is a shade of blue; we wanted to maintain the coolness of the background and avoid clashing with the grey. The shade is not too saturated and is both light enough
                            to stand out against grey and black elements and dark enough for white text to be legible against it. Blue is also only used in the periphery due to the placement of cones. The blue is used to highlight certain elements: selected
                            sections and subsections (visible on the navigation bars, promoting recognition over recall), buttons, and our logo. Our shade maintains appropriate contrast and can draw attention to these elements without causing eye strain.
                            The simple color palette will bring attention to the images we plan to include (currently using placeholders), again focusing upon the content and social issues. It also brings attention to the different colors in our central
                            Explore page that highlight the distinct options, bring energy to the application, and evoke curiosity.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            We chose to use sans-serif fonts to ensure a modern aesthetic and legibility. Sans-serif fonts are easier to read (especially on mobile devices) and against dark backgrounds. Proxima Nova is effective for usage and legibility on various screen sizes.
                            Its proportions, spacing, and overall look and feel create a simple, clear font.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition to the icons described in P3, we changed the “Scheduled/Saved” icon and added a logo and icons for filtering and sorting. Our logo is a metaphor communicating the abstract purpose of our application (saving time) through a concrete symbol
                            (clock). The logo is circular, simple, and modern, and uses a sans-serif font for increased legibility and for consistency with the rest of the app.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We chose to represent articles/activities in rounded rectangles to indicate that they are clickable but included options for other views as well, such as a list view, although not all views were shown for all screens.
